## [In Development] - Unreleased

### Changed

- Code modernization. Using Django decorators in `admin.py`
- Using `allianceauth-app-utils` to get the absolute URL


## [1.12.0] - 2022-09-15

### Added

- Local time to the bot command's output

### Changed

## [1.10.1] - 2022-06-12

- Deprecation warning when the `!time` command is used, advising to use `/time` instead

## [1.10.0] - 2022-06-07

### Added

- Cog for `allianceauth-discordbot` to implement the `/time` command for Discord
  - **Advice:** Please make sure `aadiscordbot` is listed _before_ `timezones` in
    `INSTALLED_APPS` in your `local.py` to prevent an error from spawning in your
    log file. It will still work, but the error is annoying and might cause
    unnecessary questions in the Alliance Auth support Discord.
